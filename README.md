# Work Order System

## Backend - .NET

To start this, just change directory into WorkOrderSystem and run one of the following command.
`dotnet watch` or `dotnet run`

## Frontend - Vue

To start this, change into WorkOrderFE and run the following commands.

`npm install`

This should install the dependencies for vue and vite.

`npm run dev`

This will start the frontend "server".

The backend database is a sqlite database. I couldn't open microsoft access database on my linux pc without a bunch extra packages and I was reading it might not have worked correctly. I like using spongebob characters for practice projects.
